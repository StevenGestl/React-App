              While Rocky Mountain National Park may not be as intriguing as
              Yellowstone on paper, the park still offers a ton to visitors.
              Nearly every hike leads to a view that looks like something out of
              a painting. If hiking isn’t your favorite activity you can’t go
              wrong with a drive across the park and into the tundra. Many
              drives through the park take you to the highest peaks where you
              can see some rare wildlife and take in the views.

              Rocky Mountain National park is also special to me as this is
              where I got engaged to my wife. I coordinated a sunrise hike to
              Dream Lake before there were any other hikers on the trails. The
              hike up to the lake is only about 2 miles and I remember feeling
              my nervousness build each step up the trail. As we took in the
              scenery I surprised her with a ring, and fortunately she said yes.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>A trip to Rocky Mountain National Park just may be one
              you’d never forget.
